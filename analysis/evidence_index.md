# Evidence and correctness index

Last verified: 2026-07-31 18:12 EDT

This file maps every material claim to its run identity, provenance, split policy, validation status,
and downstream use. `Decision-grade` means eligible for a predeclared scientific decision;
`diagnostic` means useful for debugging or intuition only.

## Active and completed evidence

| Claim or milestone | Grade | Dataset / stage | Runs and persistent artifact | Tested code | Split and test status | Validation / exclusion | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Single-commit seed-0 Phase-A revalidation is running | pending decision-grade | both / Stage 0 | 12-candidate manifest under `hpo_revalidation_26ad7fa/{rxrx1,camelyon17}/phase_a`; 7 active workers, 0/12 result JSONs | `26ad7fa3b0baa96fae9dab25417e42a844074636` | must be `ood_val`; must have `test_evaluated=false` | processes, GPU ownership, fresh logs, and commit parity verified; strict JSON validation pending completion | shared-recipe selection |
| Earlier Phase-A grid cannot support ranking | diagnostic only | both / Stage 0 | 12 legacy JSONs under the original `hpo/` roots | mixed: `03167d1`, `448c215`, `4795202` | OOD validation only; test not used | excluded from formal ranking because tested commits differ and an environment-ID bookkeeping defect was later repaired | implementation history only |
| Longer DINOv2 training does not by itself resolve weak RxRx1 performance | diagnostic only | RxRx1 / sanity | `hpo/rxrx1/epoch_probe/rxrx1_original_ep90_s0_epochprobe_ep90_lr1e-04_llrd0.70.json`; `...llrd0.85.json` | dirty `4795202` | `selection_split=ood_val`; `test_evaluated=false` | parseable, finite headline metrics, exact config checked; dirty/mixed provenance prevents ranking | `analysis/state_update.md`; RxRx1 sanity gate |
| Canonical WILDS ERM protocol can initialize without OOD-test construction | diagnostic guard | RxRx1 / sanity | `hpo/rxrx1/canonical_erm_dry_6fdfcf1/` | WILDS upstream `4726775` plus compatibility `6fdfcf1` | `evaluate_all_splits=false`; `eval_splits=['id_test']`; no `test_eval.csv` | zero-epoch 0.1% dry-run passed; files limited to train, val, and ID-test | launch gate for canonical reproduction |
| First canonical ERM launch failed before meaningful training | excluded failure | RxRx1 / sanity | `hpo/rxrx1/canonical_erm_sanity_6fdfcf1/launcher.log`; W&B run `26968hby` | `6fdfcf1` | OOD test not constructed or evaluated | excluded explicitly: missing optional `torch_scatter` during group-metric logging | repair audit only |
| Canonical WILDS ERM retry is training | diagnostic, pending result | RxRx1 / sanity | `hpo/rxrx1/canonical_erm_sanity_6fb65e5_retry1/`; W&B run `rytuap3l` | WILDS upstream `4726775` plus audited compatibility `6fb65e5` | validation plus ID-test only; OOD test not constructed/evaluated | native PyTorch group-mean fallback unit-smoked; process alive; GPU 0 at 95%+; log advancing; zero fatal matches at health verification | discriminate substrate/protocol failure from task/data failure |

## Exact diagnostic metrics

| Run ID | OOD-val accuracy | seen-environment accuracy | worst-environment val | Epochs | Eligibility |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `rxrx1_original_ep90_s0_epochprobe_ep90_lr1e-04_llrd0.70` | 0.0140045 | 0.0944548 | 0.0140045 | 90 | diagnostic only |
| `rxrx1_original_ep90_s0_epochprobe_ep90_lr1e-04_llrd0.85` | 0.0176578 | 0.1041810 | 0.0176578 | 90 | diagnostic only |

## Validation required before a new claim

For every completed CCAS JSON, verify parseability; finite required metrics; exact dataset, seed,
run ID, and config identity; total/active parameter fields; `selection_split=ood_val`;
`test_evaluated=false`; clean common tested commit; and expected manifest membership. Do not count a
file merely because it exists. Do not consume a Stage-1 result without its paired dense control at
the same seed. OOD test remains unavailable until the frozen Stage-3 confirmatory set is recorded.
